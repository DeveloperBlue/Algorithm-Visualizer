## Algorithm Visualizer

Algorithm Visualizer is a React Native application aiming to help students visualize different algorithms. These include the different sorting algorithms (merge, bubble, quick, etc.) along with mandelbroth and fibonaci visualizations. Features a Firebase account creation and login flow for handling more advanced datasets and to tick off the external databas/api requirements.

This project was created for CS 389 - Software Engineering

## Build

To clone and run this repository you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. From your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/DeveloperBlue/Algorithm-Visualizer.git

# Navigate into the repository
cd Algorithm-Visualizer

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start
npm start
```
Open it in the [Expo app](https://expo.io/) on your phone to view it. It will reload if you save edits to your files, and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.

Sometimes you may need to reset or clear the React Native packager's cache. To do so, you can pass the --reset-cache flag to the start script:

```bash
npm start -- --reset-cache
or
# or
yarn start -- --reset-cache
```

### Note

Due to the COVID-19 Global Pandemic, development was halted. Currently as it stands, the project only implements sorting algorithms.
